Analysis - Aave V2 Credit Scores

1. Score Distribution
Wallets were grouped into score ranges of 100 points each (0–100, 100–200, etc.). The distribution shows how many wallets fall into each range based on their behavior.

3. Score Group Behavior
• 0–100: Very risky wallets. Often liquidated. No or very low repayment.
• 100–400: Risky. Some borrowing and low repayments. Not much activity.
• 400–700: Medium risk. Wallets did some deposits and repayments, and had moderate activity.
• 700–1000: Good behavior. These wallets repaid most or all of what they borrowed, were not liquidated, and interacted over a longer time period.

5. Observations
• Wallets with high scores usually had a good repay ratio and long-term use.
• Wallets with low scores were either bots, inactive, or showed harmful behavior like frequent liquidations.

6. Use Case
This credit score can be used to filter out unreliable wallets in DeFi systems. It can help approve or reject users for borrowing, rewards, or special access based on score.
